Database
    A Database is a collection of data stored in a format that can easily be accessed
Any collection of related information
    phonebook
    shopping list
    Todo list
    Facebook's user base
Database can be stored in different ways
    on paper
    in your mind
    in computer
    powerpoint
    excel sheet
to manage databsae, we use a software application called Database Management System (DBMS)

we connect to a DBMSs and give it instructions for querying or modifying data.
The DBMS will execute our instructions and send results back

DBMS categorized into 
    - Relational
        we store data in tables that are lniked to each other using relationships.
            customers
            products
            orders
        SQL (Structured Query Language)
            it is used to work with reklational Database
            It is a language used for interacting with RDBMS.
                create, retrieve, update & delete data
                create and manage databsaes
                Design and create database tables

ALTER TABLE
    This Statement is used to add a column, alter a column, rename a column,
    drop a column and rename a table.

Add new column
    ALTER TABLE table_name
    ADD 
    new_column_name column_definition
    [FIRST | AFTER column_name]

Modify a column  (when the table is empty)
    ALTER TABLE table_name
    MODIFY column_name column_definition
    [FIRST | AFTER column_name]

Rename a column
    ALTER TABLE table_name
    CHANGE COLUMN original_name new_name column_definition
    [FIRST | AFTER column_name]

Drop a column   
    ALTER TABLE table_name
    DROP COLUMN column_name

Rename table
    ALTER TABLE table_name
    RENAME TO new_table_name

TRUNCATE  TABLE Statement
    It allows you to delete all the data in a table
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name

Generated column
    the data in these columns are computed based on predefined expressions

INSERT INTO SELECT

    INSERT INTO table_name(c1,c2,....)
    VALUES(v1,v2,.......)

    INSERT INTO table_name(column_list)
    SELECT
        select_list
    FROM 
        another_table
    WHERE
        condition

UPDATE Statement
    It updates data in a table.
    It allows you to change the values in one or more columns of a single row or multiple rows.

UPDATE table_name
SET 
    column_name1=expr1,
    column_name2=expr2,
    .....
[WHERE condition]

DELETE Statement
    It is used to delete data from a table

DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition

Constraints
    NOT NULL
        It is a column constraint that ensures values stored in a column are not null.
    column_nmae data_type NOT NULL

    ALTER TABLE table_name
    CHANGE
        old_column_name
        new_column_nmae column_definition

    Primary Key
        not null + unique
    It is a column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in the table.
        A primary key must conatin unique values.
        if the primary key consists of multiple columns, the combination of values in these columns must be unique.
        A primary key cannnot have null values.
        A table can have only one primary key.
        A primary key column often has the AUTO_INCREMENT attribute that automatically generates a sequential integre whenever you insert a new row into the table.
    CREATE TABLE table_name(
    primary_key_column datatype PRIMARY KEY,
    .......);

    CREATE TABLE table_name(
    primary_key_column datatype,
    primary_key_column datatype,
    ........
    PRIMARY KEY(primary_key_column));

    Foreign Key
    It is a column or group of columns in a table that links to a column or group of columns in another table.

    customers  --parent table / referenced table
        *customerId  -- primary key
        customerName
        phone
        address
        country

    orders  -- child table / referencing table
        *orderNumber -- primary key
        orderDate
        requiredDate
        ShippedDate
        status
        comments
        customerId -- Foreign Key

Typically, the foreign key columns of the child table often referes to the primary key of the parent table.
A table can have more than one foreign key where each foreign key references to a primary key of the different parent tables

[CONSTRAINT constraint_name]
FOREIGN KEY [foreign_key_name] (column_name,...)
REFERENCES parent_table(column_name,....)
[ON DELETE referenceoption]
[ON UPDATE referenceoption]

    Unique Constratint
        t is an integrity constarint that ensures values in a column or group of columns to be unique.
    
    CREATE TABLE table_name(
        ......,
        column_name data_type UNIQUE,
        .......
    );
    Check Constraint
    It is used to apply user defined constraint
    [CONSTRINT [constraint_name]] CHECK (expression)[[NOT]ENFORCED]

JOIN 
    A join is a method of linking data between one or more tables based on values of the common column between the tables.
Inner join
    SELECT column_list
    FROM table_1
    INNER JOIN table_2 ON join_condition

Left join
    it selects all data from the left table whether there are matching rows exists in the right table or not.
    SELECT column_list
    FROM table_1
    LEFT JOIN table_2 ON join_condition
Right join
    it selects all data from the right table whether there are matching rows exists in the left table or not.
    SELECT column_list
    FROM table_1
    RIGHT JOIN table_2 ON join_condition
Cross join
    it makes a cartesian product of rows from the joined tables.
    it combines each row from the first table with every row from the right tabale to make the result set.
    SELECT column_list
    FROM table_1
    CROSS JOIN table_2
    It is useful for generating planning data.
Self join   
    It is used to query hierarchial data or to compare a row with other rows within the same table
Subquery
    It is a query nested within another query
    subquery is called an inner query and the query that contains the subquery is called an outer query.
    standalone subquery
        the inner query executes first and the result used in the outer query
    corelated subquery
        uses the data from the outer query. it is evaluated once for each row in the outer query
