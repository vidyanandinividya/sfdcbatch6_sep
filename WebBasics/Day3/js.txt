JavaScript
    It is a high-level object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language

    high level - no need to worry about complex stuff like memory management

    object-oriented - based on objects for storing most kinds of data

    multi-paradigm - we can use different styles of programming

    <script> 
    Data Types
        Number - Floating point numbers - used for deciamls and integers
        String - Sequence of characters used for text
        Boolean - Logical type that can only be true or false used for taking decissions
        undefined - value taken by a variable that is not defined ('empty value')
        Null - also means empty value
        BigInt - larger integers than number type can hold
    const 
        variables declared with const maintain constant values.
        These values cannot be updated or re-declared
    var 
        var declarations are globally scoped 
    let 
        it is block scoped 
        a variable declared with let is only available for use within that block
        These variables can not be redeclared
CC #1
    Mark and John are trying to comapre their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass/height **2 
    mas/(height*height). (mass in kg and height in meter)

    1. store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
    2. calculate both their BMIs using the formula 
    3. Create a boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
    Sample Date 
        Test1: Mark wiight : 78 height : 1.69 John weight: 92 height: 1.95
        Test2: Mark wiight : 95 height : 1.88 John weight: 85 height: 1.76
CC #2
    use the BMI code from CC#1 and improve it,
    1. print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message can be either "Mark's BMI is higher that John's !" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's"
    2. use a template literal to include BMI values in the output. 
    Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9) !"
== (loose) and === (strict)
Function
    It is a set of statements that perform a task or calculate a value

    Function declaration
        function that can be used before it's declared
    Function expression
        essentially a function value stored in a variable
    Arrow function
        Great for a quick one-line function
        (parameters)=>{expression}
Array

what JavaScript can do with webpages
    you can access the web page elements using JS programs
    you can change the content of the webpage elements dynamically
DOM 
    Document Object Model
    It is structured representation of HTML elements as an Object
    it resides in the global object known as window
getElementById()
    it returns a webpage element that has the id attribute same as the id value specified in getElementById() method
