variable and data type
    variable is created to store the value

Data type is a classification of data .
primitive 
    byte
    short
    int 
    int age=32
    long
    float
    double 
    char
    boolean
reference
    Array
    String
    Interface
valid 
    age
    $age
    age_john
    age12
Not valid
    age joh 
    12age
    age!

Input
    refers to the text written by the user read by the program.
    input is always read as a string.
Object
    example
    example extends Object
conditional statement
    if 
    if else 
    if else if else 
Loop
    a loop consists of an expression that determines whether or not the code within the loop should be repeated, along with a block containing the source code to be repeated.

    while  - infine loop
    do while -- infine loop
    for  - finite loop
CC#1
    write a program which reads numbers from the user until the user writes 0.
    Then the program prints the number of positive and negative numbers and the percentage of positive numbers from all negative numbers given.
Array
    It is a collection of similar type of element
    Size of the array = the number of elements in the array
    The values in an Array are called element
    Array always start from index 0
    int[] numbers = new int[5]; //this array will hold five integers
    numbers[0] =23
    numbers[1]=2
    String[] names=new String[3] //this array will hold three strings
CC#2
    check whether the given array is sorted in ascending order or not
        if the array is null or has only one element then array is already sorted

Classes and Objects
    class 
        it defines the attributes of objects.
            -- instance variables
            -- instance methods
                it is a piece of source code written inside a class that's been names and has the ability to be called.
    object 
        it is an instance of class
        it is always instanciated by calling a method that created an object i.e. constructor by using new keyword

        class Employee{}

        Employee emp=new Employee();
    constructor
        it is used to allocate memory at run time

        default constructor
            if the programmer does not define a constructor for a class, java automatically creates a default one for it.
            if a constructor has been defined for a class, no default constructor exists.
    Access Specifiers
            default -- package level
            public  -- universal
            private -- limited to that class 
            protected -- accessible to only the child of the class
            class must not be private or protected
    toString()
        the string representation of an object
