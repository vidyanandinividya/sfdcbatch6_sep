OOPS Concept
    Encapsulation
        It is the process by which data(variables) and the code that acts upon them(methods) are integrated as a single unit.
        By encapsulating a class's variables, other classes can not access them, and only the methods of the class can access them.
        - Better control
        - Getter and Setter
        - Security
        - Flexibility
    Inheritance 
        In inheritance relationship, a class can access fields and methods of an existing class.

        Existing class is known as base / parent / super class
        The class who access the features i.e. fields and methods of a base class is known as sub / derived /child class.

        Class A{}
        Class B extends A{}

        Types of Inheritance
            Single Inheritance
                There should be one base class and one child class
            Multilevel Inheritance
                In multilvel inheritance, a class is derived from another class which is also derived from some other class
            Class A {}
            Class B extends A {}
            Class C extends B {}
            Hierarchial Inheritance
                There can be multiple sub class for one base class
            Hybrid Inheritance
                In this we use mixed of different types of inheritance relationship.
            Multiple Inheritance    
                Iin this relationship, the derived class derived from multiple base class
            Class A {}
            Class B {}
            Class C extends A , B {}
            Multiple inheritance can be implemented using interface not classes
        Advantage
            Code reusability
        Every Java class extends the class Object, which means that every class we create has its disposal all methods defined in the Object class.
        we use the extends keyword to inherit the properties of a class.
        Inheritance -- Is-A relationship
        child class can inherit all the pri=operties from the base class except constructor.
        The super call bears same resemblance to the this call in a constructor, this is used to call a constructor of this class, while super is used to call a constructor of the superclass.
        you can call the methods defined in the superclass by prefixing the call with super keyword.

    Misusing Inheritance
        Let's consider a Postal service and some related class.
            Customer
                includes the information related to a customer
            Order
                includes the information about the ordered item by the customer
            Order has a Customer 
    When inheriting, the sub class must be a special case of the super class.
    Association 
    in Java, it is the relationship that can be establihed between any two classes.
        one-to-one 
        one-to-many
        many-to-one
        many-to-many
    There are two forms of Association
        IS - A (Inheritance)
        HAS - A (association)
            - Aggregation
            It is a relatively more loosely coupled relation than composition,
            although both classes are associated with each other, one can exist without other independently
            It is also called weak association
            It is also known as unidirectional association
            Association between Country and Sportsperson
            Country class is defined with a name and other attributes like size, population, capital etc, and a list of all the sportspersons that come from it
            Sportsperson class is defined with a name and other attributes like age , height, weight etc.


            - Composition
            It is a form of relation that is more tightly coupled.
            It is also called strong association
            It is also know as Belongs-To association
            In this association, the classes cannot exist independent of each other.
            If the larger class which holds the object of the smaller class is removed, it is also means logically the smaller class cannot exist.
            Association between Organization and Employee
            Organization class is defined with name and the list of employees that are employed in it.
            Employee class is defined with name and the organization he/she is working at.

    Polymorphism
        It is a concept where one name can have many forms
        It is just the ability of a method to behave differntly at different situation, and this is actually achieved by Method Overloading or by Method Overriding
        Example:
         getArea(int radius) {return 3.14*radius*radius} 
            used to calculate area of Circle
         getArea(int length,int breadth){return length*breadth}
            used to calculate area of Rectangle
        getArea() -By looking at this name, you will come to know that the method is used to calculate area.
        Area of what that will not come to know
        After looking at parameters, you will exactly come to know that,
            1. first method is used to calculate the area of Circle
            2. second method is used to calculate the area of Rectangle
        
    Types of Polymorphism
        Static Polymorphism / Static Binding / Compile time Polymorphism 
            any method call which is resolved at COMPILER level is called static polymorphism 
            Method Overloading
                if a class have multiple methods with the same name but with different parameter list, it is known as Method Overloading
                parameter lists should differ in either
                    1. Number of parameters
                    2. Data type of parameters
                    3. Sequence of data type of parameters
                It increases the readability of the program
        Dynamic Polymorphism / Dynamic Binding / Run time Polymorphism
            any method call which is resolved at JVM level is called dynamic polymorphism
            Method overriding
                in case of inheritance , where parent-child relationship exist
            parent class defines a method say connect() 
                    which does connection to some remote service
            Child class has a better way to do connection than parent class and don't want to use Parent class connect() method.
                So , it overrides Parent's class connect() method by providing own implemenation of connect() method.
            Now whenever connect() method is called using child class object then connect() method of child class will be called and not the connect() method of Parent class.
            This is called method overriding

            parameters that need to be consider in case of method overriding
                1. Access specifier of method
                2. Return type of the method
                3. Name of a method
                4. Arguments/ parameters of method
                5. Exception that method throws
    Abstraction
