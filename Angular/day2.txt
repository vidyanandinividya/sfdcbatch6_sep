Directive
    These are instructions in the DOM
    It is a way to extend our HTML including both view as well as behaviour
    Mainly 3 types of Directives
        Component Directive
        Structural Directive
            ngIf
            ngFor
            ngSwitch
        asterisk (*) means its a built in structural directive
        Attribute Directuve
            ngClass
            ngStyle
        custom Directive
            ng g d directivename
#CC 1
    Add a button which says "Display Details"
    Add a paragraph with any content of your choice ("secret passowrd=true")
    Toggle the displaying of that paragraph with the button created in the first step
    Log all the button clicks in an array and output that array below the secret paragraph (may be log a timstamp or simply an increasing number)
    starting at the 5th log item, give all future log items a blue background (via ngStyle) and white color (ngClass)
Forms
    vital for business application
    create an experience that guides the user efficiently and effectively through the workflow

    Template Driven Form (TDF)
        Heavy on the component template
        Easy to use and similar to HTML Forms
        two way data binding with ngModel
        Bulky HTML and minimal component code
        Automatically tracks the form and form elements state and validity
        Unit testing is challenge
        Readability decreases with complex forms and validations
        Suitable simple scenarios

        state                                class if true       class if false
        The control has been visited            ng-touched          ng-untouched
        The control's value has changed         ng-dirty            ng-pristine
        The control's value is valid            ng-valid            ng-invalid

        ngModel Properties
        class               Property
        ng-untouched        untouched
        ng-touched          touched
        ng-pristine         pristine
        ng-dirty            dirty
        ng-valid            valid
