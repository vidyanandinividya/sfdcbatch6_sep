Pipe
    These are used to transfer data before displaying them in the view
    - built in Pipe
    - custom Pipe
        ng g pipe pipename
Service
    Principle
        DO Not Repeat Yourself (DRY)
        Single Responsibility Priniciple
Service
    A class with a specific purpose

    Share date
    Implement application logic
    External interaction

.service.ts 
    ng g servcie servcieName

code without DI 

class Engine
{
    constructor(){}
}
class Engine
{
    constructor(newparameter){}
}
class Tires
{
    constructor(){}
}
class Car
{
    engine;
    tires;
    constructor()
    {
        this.engine=new Engine(); //error
        this.tires=new Tires()
    }
}
Dependency Injection 
    DI is a coding pattern in which a class receives its dependencies from external sources rather than creating them itself

code with DI
class Car
{
    engine;
    tires;
    constructor(engine,tyre)
    {
        this.engine=engine
        this.tires=tyre
    }
}
var myEngine=new Engine();
var myTires=new Tires();
var myCar=new Car(myEngine,myTires)

var myEngine=new Engine(parameter);
var myTires=new Tires();
var myCar=new Car(myEngine,myTires)

DI as a Framework
    Define the EmployeeService class
    Register with Injector
    Decalre as dependency in EmpList adn EmpDetails

        EmployeeService   -- Injector -- Get -- Http -- server
         the respone is in the form of Obeservable
Obeservable
    It is a sequence of items that arrived asynchnously over time
    HTTP call - single items
    single item - HTTP response

HTTP, Observables and RxJS
    1. HTTP Get request from EmpService 
    2. Receive the observable and cast it into an employee array
    3. subscribe to the obseravble from EmpList and EmpDetails
    4. Assign the employee array to a local variable

    HTTP methods
        To fetch the data - Get
        To create the data - Post
        To update the data - Put
        to delete the data - Delete

    RxJS
        Reactive Extensions for JavaScript
        External library to work with observables
        EmpList
        EMpDetails
